## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I am interested in this dataset because of my interest in watching and playing soccer. I have watched a lot of the matches in this dataset live and also root for some of the teams. As this dataset contains a lot of information, I hope to look at a numerous amounts of things. Including but not limited too: how well the predictive models does in predicting the actual score, how many times the team with the higher probability actually wins the match, determining whether the importance of a match plays a factor in if a team wins or not, and if the estimates of xg and nxg are a good estimate given the actual score of the match. Lastly, my interest in the dataset lies in the fact that I make some occasional sports bets and if this predictive model is determined a good indication of the actual score this could help out immensely. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset I chose was published by FiveThirtyEight. The data was taken from ESPN's database and Engsoccerdata GitHub repository. This dataset consists of Club Soccer Teams and predictions of their match scores. Specifically in the dataset there contains around 10,000 rows filled in with each match taking place over 2019 and 2020. Some of the information given is: Season (2019 or 2020), Date, League Name, Both Team Names, the SPI ranking of each team (calculated depending on a number of factors), the probability of team 1 or 2 winning (along with probably of a tie), the projected scores for both teams, the importance the game is to both teams, the actual score of the game if it has already taken place, xg (an estimate of how many goals a team should have scored given the number of shots they took), nxg (how many goals a team should of scored based on actions they took around the opposing goal), and lastly the adjusted goals (the conditions under which each goal was scored). Overall the purpose of this dataset is to measure how the predictive model does against the actual scores of the games and consistently change the factors that are taken into account to predict the scores.
